    "Theia is an open source IDE(Integrated Development Environment), that can be run on desktop or on cloud. You will be using the Theia IDE to do this lab. When you log into the Theia environment, you are presented with a 'dedicated computer on the cloud' exclusively for you. This is available to you as long as you work on the labs. Once you log off, this 'dedicated computer on the cloud' is deleted along with any files you may have created. So, it is a good idea to finish your labs in a single session. If you finish part of the lab and return to the Theia lab later, you may have to start from the beginning. Plan to work out all your Theia labs when you have the time to finish the complete lab in a single session."
