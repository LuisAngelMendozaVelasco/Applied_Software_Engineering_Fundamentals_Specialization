# Python Programming Fundamentals

This module discusses Python fundamentals and begins with the concepts of conditions and branching. Continue through the module and learn how to implement loops to iterate over sequences, create functions to perform a specific task, perform exception handling to catch errors, and how classes are needed to create objects.

## Learning Objectives

- Classify conditions and branching by identifying structured scenarios with outputs.
- Work with objects and classes.
- Explain objects and classes by identifying data types and creating a class.
- Use exception handling in Python.
- Explain what functions do.
- Build a function using inputs and outputs.
- Explain how for loops and while loops work.
- Work with condition statements in Python, including operators and branching.
- Create and use loop statements in Python.
