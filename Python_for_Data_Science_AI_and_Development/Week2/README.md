# Python Data Structures

This module begins a journey into Python data structures by explaining the use of lists and tuples and how they are able to store collections of data in a single variable. Next learn about dictionaries and how they function by storing data in pairs of keys and values, and end with Python sets to learn how this type of collection can appear in any order and will only contain unique elements.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe and manipulate tuple combinations and list data structures.
- Execute basic tuple operations in Python.
- Perform list operations in Python.
- Write structures with correct keys and values to demonstrate understanding of dictionaries.
- Work with and perform operations on dictionaries in Python.
- Create sets to demonstrate understanding of the differences between sets, tuples, and lists.
- Work with sets in Python, including operations and logic operations.
