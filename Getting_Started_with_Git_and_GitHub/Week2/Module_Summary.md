# Module Summary

In this module, you learned that:

- Branches are used to isolate changes to code. When the changes are complete, they can be merged back into the main branch.
- Repositories can be cloned to make it possible to work locally, then sync changes back to the original.
- Repositories can be forked to be used as a base for a new project, or so that the developer can work independently.
- A Pull Request (PR) can be submitted to have your changes reviewed and merged.
- Large projects include people working in different roles:
- Developer – creates code
- Integrator – manages changes made by developers
- Repository Administrator – configures and maintains access to the repository
