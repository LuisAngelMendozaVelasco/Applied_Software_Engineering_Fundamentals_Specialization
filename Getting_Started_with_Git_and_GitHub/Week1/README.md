# Git and GitHub Fundamentals

Application developers rarely work alone. Large web/cloud/mobile development and data science projects will include many people â€“ front-end developers, back-end developers, database administrators, repository administrators, and others. Every change by every contributor must be tracked and controlled to enable collaboration, accountability and version management. This type of distributed version control is extremely important when managing both small and large software projects. In this module you will learn about some of the popular version control tools, create a GitHub account and use the GitHub web interface to create a repository, add a file to it and commit your changes.

## Learning Objectives

- Define distributed version control.
- List several tools used for version control including popular Git platforms.
- Describe basic git concepts and the purpose of repositories.
