# Software Architecture, Design, and Patterns

In this module, you will learn about the foundations of enterprise software development. Lesson 1 introduces you to software architecture and explains the importance of well-designed architecture. You will also learn about the design process, including structural design, behavioral models, and how you can create unified modeling language (UML) diagrams to communicate a softwareâ€™s structure and behavior to all team members. You will also consider object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). In Lesson 2 you will explore a variety of architectural patterns that support the architectural design process in a hands-on activity. Lastly, you will learn about the software production environment and some of the components required for deployment.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe what software architecture is and explain its importance.
- Compare and contrast structural design with behavioral models and discuss the usefulness of UML diagrams to communicate structure and behavior.
- Explain object-oriented analysis and design.
- Describe component-based and service-oriented architectures and the characteristics of distributed systems.
- Differentiate among 2-tier, 3-tier, peer-to-peer, event-driven, and microservices architectural patterns and provide examples of each pattern.
- Differentiate between production and pre-production environments.
- Describe components commonly required in a production environment.
- Recognize diagrams of architectural patterns based on their descriptions.
