# Introduction to Software Development

This module introduces you to the concepts of application development. In lesson 1 you’ll learn about the differences in front-end and back-end development in web and cloud applications and the technologies used in both. You’ll also learn about how working in teams and pairs can enhance the development process and make it more efficient. In lesson 2 you will explore many of the application development tools that a software engineer uses to write, test, and release code and be introduced to software stacks that support the execution of an application. Finally, in the hands-on lab, you’ll learn how to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop and run code.
