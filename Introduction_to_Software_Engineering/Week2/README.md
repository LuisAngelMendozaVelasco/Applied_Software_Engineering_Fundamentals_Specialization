# Introduction to Software Development

This module introduces you to the concepts of application development. In lesson 1 you’ll learn about the differences in front-end and back-end development in web and cloud applications and the technologies used in both. You’ll also learn about how working in teams and pairs can enhance the development process and make it more efficient. In lesson 2 you will explore many of the application development tools that a software engineer uses to write, test, and release code and be introduced to software stacks that support the execution of an application. Finally, in the hands-on lab, you’ll learn how to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop and run code.

# Learning Objectives

- Describe how websites and cloud applications work.
- Identify the technologies you can use to create reactive and responsive websites.
- Identify the back-end technologies you can use to create functionality in your websites.
- Describe how teams and squads work in a software engineering context.
- Identify the benefits of different pair programming styles.
- Classify common web technologies into front-end and back-end technologies.
- Identify commonly used types of development tools, including version control software, libraries, and frameworks.
- Describe how some key developer tools work, including CI/CD tools, build tools, packages, and package managers.
- Describe software stacks and identify the advantages of three popular stacks.
- Identify parts of an IDE and use them to create a simple software application.
