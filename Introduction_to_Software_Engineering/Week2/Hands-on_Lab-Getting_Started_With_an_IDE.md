# Hands-on Lab: Getting Started With an IDE

In this lab you will become familiar using an IDE. The IDE that you will be using is called Skills Network Cloud IDE which is based on an open-source project called Theia.  This IDE is very similar to the popular VS Code IDE. In this lab you will explore the IDE and use it to create and run a simple Python application. You will create a code file, save it, and edit it to make changes."
