# SDLC - The Software Development Lifecyle

This module provides you with an overview to the field of software engineering. In the first lesson of this module, you will be introduced to the field of software engineering, and learn about the software development lifecycle (SDLC), elements of building high-quality software, and writing requirements. In lesson two you will explore different approaches to building software and different career opportunities related to software development. You will also hear from experienced practitioners in the field and learn how different roles interact and work with each other as a team in order to develop enterprise-level software.
