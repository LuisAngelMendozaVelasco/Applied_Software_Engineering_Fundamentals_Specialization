# SDLC - The Software Development Lifecyle

This module provides you with an overview to the field of software engineering. In the first lesson of this module, you will be introduced to the field of software engineering, and learn about the software development lifecycle (SDLC), elements of building high-quality software, and writing requirements. In lesson two you will explore different approaches to building software and different career opportunities related to software development. You will also hear from experienced practitioners in the field and learn how different roles interact and work with each other as a team in order to develop enterprise-level software.

## Learning Objectives

- Define software engineering and explain the responsibilities of a software engineer.
- Discuss key advantages of applying the software development lifecycle (SDLC) when developing enterprise software.
- Describe each phase of the SDLC
- Analyze common software engineering processes required for building-high quality software.
- Explain the requirement gathering process.
- Differentiate between a User Requirement Specification (URS), a Software Requirement Specification (SRS), and a System Requirement Specification (SysRS) document.
- Compare and contrast waterfall, V-shape model, and agile methods of software development.
- Distinguish between functional, non-functional, and regression testing.
- Identify and describe different types of documentation.
- Compare and contrast the common roles and responsibilities on a software engineering project.
