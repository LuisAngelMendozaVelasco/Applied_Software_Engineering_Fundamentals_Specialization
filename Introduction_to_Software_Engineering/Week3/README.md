# Basics of Programming

This module introduces you to the basics of programming. In the first lesson, you will learn about the different categories of programming languages and the scenarios to which each is suited. You’ll also learn how to plan and organize your code effectively. In lesson 2 you will explore basic programming logic and investigate programming concepts such as identifiers, functions, and objects. Finally, in the hands-on lab, you’ll learn how to write simple Python code.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify interpreted programming languages and compiled programming languages.
- Compare interpreted and compiled programming languages.
- Describe query languages and assembly languages.
- Define the two main methods of organizing and planning code and describe the advantages of each.
- Design simple flowcharts.
- List the differences between branching and looping.
- Describe the purpose and use of identifiers and containers.
- Describe the purpose and use of functions and objects.
- Write and run simple Python code that uses variables, constants, arrays, loops, and conditional logic.
