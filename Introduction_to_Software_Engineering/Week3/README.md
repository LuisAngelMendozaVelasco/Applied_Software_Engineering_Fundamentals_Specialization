# Basics of Programming

This module introduces you to the basics of programming. In the first lesson, you will learn about the different categories of programming languages and the scenarios to which each is suited. You’ll also learn how to plan and organize your code effectively. In lesson 2 you will explore basic programming logic and investigate programming concepts such as identifiers, functions, and objects. Finally, in the hands-on lab, you’ll learn how to write simple Python code.
