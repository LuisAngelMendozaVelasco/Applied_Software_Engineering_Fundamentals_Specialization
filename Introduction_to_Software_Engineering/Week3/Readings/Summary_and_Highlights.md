# Summary & Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know: 

- Interpreted programming languages create source code that runs through an interpreter and is built into your operating system (OS) on your computer or on your web browser. 
- Compiled programming languages create executable files that are grouped in programs on your computer or device.  
- Query languages, structured programming languages, and object-oriented programming languages are categorized as high-level programming languages and assembly languages are categorized as low-level programming languages.  
- The two main methods of organizing and planning code are by developing flowcharts and by writing pseudocode. Flowcharts are pictorial representations of algorithms and pseudocode is an explanation of the function of each line of a program. 
- To reference a program component, software developers use an identifier, which can either be a constant or a variable.  
- A function is a piece of structured, stand-alone, and reusable code that will perform a single specific action.  
- Object-oriented programming is a programming methodology that is focused on objects rather than functions.
